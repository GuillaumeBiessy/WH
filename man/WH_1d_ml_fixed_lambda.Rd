\usage{
WH_1d_ml_fixed_lambda(
  d,
  ec,
  lambda = 1000,
  p = length(d),
  q = 2,
  verbose = FALSE,
  accu_dev = 1e-12
)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Vector of observed events}

\item{ec}{Vector of central exposure}

\item{lambda}{Smoothing parameter}

\item{p}{The number of eigenvectors to keep}

\item{q}{Order of penalization. Polynoms of degrees q - 1 are considered
smooth and are therefore unpenalized}

\item{verbose}{Should information about the optimization progress be
displayed}

\item{accu_dev}{Tolerance for the convergence of the optimization procedure}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"WH_1d"} i.e. a list containing model fit,
variance, residuals and degrees of freedom as well as diagnosis to asses
the quality of the fit.
