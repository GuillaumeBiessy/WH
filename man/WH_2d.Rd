\arguments{
\item{d}{Matrix of observed events whose rows and columns should be named.
Required in case of maximum likelihood estimation}

\item{ec}{Matrix of central exposure. Required in case of maximum likelihood
estimation. The central exposure corresponds to the sum of the exposure
period over the insured population. An individual experiencing an event of
interest during the year will no longer be exposed afterward and the
exposure should be reduced accordingly.}

\item{lambda}{Smoothing parameter vector of size \code{2}. If missing, an
optimization procedure will be used to find the optimal smoothing
parameter. If provided, no optimal smoothing parameter search will take
place unless the \code{criterion} argument is also provided, in which case
\code{lambda} will be used as the starting parameter for the optimization
procedure.}

\item{criterion}{Criterion to be used for the selection of the optimal
smoothing parameter. Default is \code{"REML"} which stands for restricted
maximum likelihood. Other options include \code{"AIC"}, \code{"BIC"} and \code{"GCV"}.}

\item{method}{Method to be used to find the optimal smoothing parameter.
Default to \code{"fixed_lambda"} if \code{lambda} is supplied, meaning no
optimization is performed. Otherwise, if \code{criterion = "REML"} or the
\code{criterion} argument is missing, default to \code{"fs"} which means the
generalized Fellner-Schall method is used. For other criteria default to
\code{"optim"} meaning the \code{optimize} function from package \code{stats}
will be used.}

\item{p}{Optional vector of size \code{2}. Maximum number of eigenvectors to
keep on each dimension after performing the eigen decomposition of the
penalization matrix. If missing, will be automatically computed so that the
dimensions of (square) matrices involved in the optimization problem
remains lower that the \code{max_dim} argument}

\item{max_dim}{Maximal number of rows (or equivalently columns) of the square
matrices that should be involved in the optimization problem. Default is
\code{500}. Values higher than \code{2000} may cause issues with both
memory usage and computation times.}

\item{q}{Order of penalization vector of size \code{2}. Polynoms of degrees
\code{(q[[1]] - 1,q[[2]] - 1)} are considered smooth and are therefore
unpenalized. Should be left to the default of \code{c(2,2)} for most
practical applications.}

\item{framework}{Default framework is \code{"ml"} which stands for maximum
likelihood unless the \code{y} argument is also provided, in which case the
\code{"reg"} or regression framework is used. The regression framework is an
asymptotical approximation of the maximum likelihood likelihood framework.}

\item{y}{Optional matrix of observations whose rows and columns should be
named. Used only in the regression framework and even in this case will be
automatically computed if the \code{d} and \code{ec} arguments are
supplied. May be useful when using Whittaker-Henderson smoothing outside of
the survival analysis framework.}

\item{wt}{Optional matrix of weights. As for the observation vector \code{y},
used only in the regression framework and even in this case will be
automatically computed if the \code{d} argument is supplied. May be useful
when using Whittaker-Henderson smoothing outside of the survival analysis
framework.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to the smoothing function called.}

\value{
An object of class \code{WH_2d}.

\description{
#' Main package function to apply Whittaker-Henderson smoothing in a
bidimensional survival analysis framework. It takes as input a matrix of
observed events and a matrix of associated central exposure, both depending
on two covariates, and build a smooth version of the log-hazard rate.
Smoothing parameters may be supplied or automatically chosen according to a
specific criterion such as \code{"REML"} (the default), \code{"AIC"}, \code{"BIC"} or
\code{"GCV"}. Whittaker-Henderson may be applied in a full maximum likelihood
framework or an asymptotic (approximate) gaussian framework. As
Whittaker-Henderson smoothing relies on full-rank smoothers, computation time
and memory usage in the bidimensional case may be overwhelming and the
function integrates an ad hoc rank-reduction procedure to avoid such issues.
