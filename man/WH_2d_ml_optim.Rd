\usage{
WH_2d_ml_optim(
  d,
  ec,
  q = c(2, 2),
  p = dim(d),
  criterion = "REML",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Vector of observed events}

\item{ec}{Vector of central exposure}

\item{q}{Matrix of orders of penalization. Polynoms of degrees q - 1 are considered
smooth and are therefore unpenalized}

\item{p}{The number of eigenvectors to keep on each dimension}

\item{criterion}{Criterion used to choose the smoothing parameter. One of
"GCV" (default), "AIC" or "BIC".}

\item{lambda}{Vector of smoothing parameter}

\item{verbose}{Should information about the optimization progress be
displayed}

\item{accu_edf}{Tolerance for the convergence of the outer optimization
procedure}

\item{accu_dev}{Tolerance for the convergence of the optimization procedure}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"WH_2d"} i.e. a list containing model fit,
variance, residuals and degrees of freedom as well as diagnosis to asses
the quality of the fit.
