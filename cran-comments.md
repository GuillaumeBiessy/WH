## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Replaced utils::person by person in the author field of the DESCRIPTION

* Updated the description field of the DESCRIPTION file to simplify it and include a link to the paper whose methods are implemented in the package

* Replaced the backquotes by normal quotes in the description field of the DESCRIPTION
