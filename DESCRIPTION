Description: Implementation of Whittaker-Henderson Smoothing for the gradation 
    of actuarial tables for Life Insurance risks such as mortality, disability, 
    long-term care and unemployment. The package handles one-dimensional and 
    two-dimensional tables in the framework of maximum likelihood estimation or 
    an approximate regression framework. It performs automatic selection of 
    smoothing parameters by marginal likelihood maximisation. 
    Smoothing should be applied to vectors / matrices containing numbers of 
    observed events and associated central risk exposure. Extrapolation beyond 
    the range of data is also implemented.
