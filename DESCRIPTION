Description: Implementation of Whittaker-Henderson Smoothing for the gradation 
  of actuarial tables for person insurance risks such as mortality, disability, 
  long-term care and unemployment. The package covers tables in 1 or 2 dimensions
  and perform automatic selection of the smoothing parameters. Smoothing is 
  performed over vectors / matrices containing the number of observed events and 
  the associated central risk exposure in the framework of maximum likelihood 
  estimation or an approximate regression framework. Optimal parameter selection
  may be performed using the Nelder-Mead algorithm from the optim function in the
  stats package or using the generalized Fellner-Schall update formula.
