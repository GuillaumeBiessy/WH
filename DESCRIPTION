Description: Implementation of Whittaker-Henderson Smoothing for the gradation 
    of actuarial tables for Life Insurance risks such as mortality, disability, 
    long-term care and unemployment. The package handles tables in 1 or 2 dimensions
    and performs automatic selection of smoothing parameters. Smoothing is 
    applied to vectors / matrices containing the number of observed events and 
    the associated central risk exposure in the framework of maximum likelihood 
    estimation or an approximate regression framework. Optimal parameter selection
    relies on marginal likelihood maximisation. Extrapolation beyond the range of 
    data is also available.
