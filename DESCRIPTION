Description: Implementation of Whittaker-Henderson Smoothing for the gradation 
    of actuarial tables for person insurance risks such as mortality, disability, 
    long-term care and unemployment. The package handles tables in 1 or 2 dimensions
    and performs automatic selection of the smoothing parameters. Smoothing is 
    applied to vectors / matrices containing the number of observed events and 
    the associated central risk exposure in the framework of maximum likelihood 
    estimation or an approximate regression framework. Optimal parameter selection
    relies on the Nelder-Mead algorithm from the optim function in the
    stats package or uses the generalized Fellner-Schall update formula.
